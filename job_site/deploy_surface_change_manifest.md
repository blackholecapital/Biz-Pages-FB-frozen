# Deploy Surface Change Manifest — RB-INT-CHASSIS-002

job_id: RB-INT-CHASSIS-002
stage: S3
pass: deploy app root only
worker: worker_a
authority: record of exact file-system changes made under apps/product-shell/ for the deploy app surface
source_matrix: /job_site/missing_surface_matrix.yaml

## 1. Scope Lock (enforced)

This pass creates exactly the deploy app root surfaces declared in the S2 target
path manifest scope_lock. All other missing baseline surfaces (modules, admin
apps, full component tree, full public assets, tests, production, resolver,
variation, review, docs) are explicitly deferred and NOT touched by this pass.

---

## 6. Out-of-Scope (deferred)

The following baseline deploy-app surfaces are NOT created by this pass and
remain classified `missing` in `/job_site/missing_surface_matrix.yaml`:

- `apps/product-shell/src/components/` (23 component files under admin/, cards/, gate/, integrations/, layout/, nav/, tenant/)
- `apps/product-shell/src/config/` (nav.config.ts, pageBackgrounds.ts, staticPageAssets.ts)
- `apps/product-shell/src/contracts/microfrontend.ts`
- `apps/product-shell/src/features/` (engage, marketplace, payme, referrals)
- `apps/product-shell/src/hooks/` (usePublishedExclusiveTiles.ts, useViewportMode.ts)
- `apps/product-shell/src/integrations/spine/` (bridge.ts, index.ts, registry.ts, types.ts)
- `apps/product-shell/src/pages/` (11 pages)
- `apps/product-shell/src/runtime/` (4 runtime files)
- `apps/product-shell/src/state/demoGateState.tsx`
- `apps/product-shell/src/styles/` (8 CSS files)
- `apps/product-shell/src/utils/` (5 util files)
- `apps/product-shell/src/mobile/`
- `apps/product-shell/public/ads/`, `public/apps/`, `public/demo/`, `public/wallpapers/`, `drip.png`
- `apps/product-shell/tests/microfrontend/`
- `apps/product-shell/README.md`, `blueprint/`, `docs/`
- Module packages: `modules/engage`, `modules/payme`, `modules/referrals`, `modules/vault`
- Admin apps: `engagefi-admin-minimal`, `payme-admin-minimal`, `referral-admin-minimal`
- `production/`, `resolver-boundary/`, `variation-control/`, `_review-required/`

A subsequent S3 or S4 pass is required to rebuild these surfaces before
the tree is buildable or Pages-deployable.

---

## 7. Build-Time Dependency Alert

`apps/product-shell/package.json` declares `build` as
`npm run build:engage && vite build`. `build:engage` resolves the sibling
directory `../modules/engage` relative to `apps/product-shell/`, i.e.
`apps/modules/engage`, which does NOT exist in the current tree.

- A `vite build` run from `apps/product-shell` would also fail before
  reaching the engage step because `apps/product-shell/src/main.tsx` imports
  from `./app/AppShell`, which itself imports from `../components/*`,
  `../pages/*`, `../features/*`, and `../runtime/*` — none of which are
  created by this pass.

Build verification is therefore OUT OF SCOPE for this S3 pass and is
deferred to a later S3 / S4 pass and the S5 build verification step.

---

## 8. Conflicts Flagged (non-blocking for this pass)

### 8.1 pages_deployment_spec.md (on main) deploy root mismatch

`/job_site/pages_deployment_spec.md` (as present on origin/main) declares
`deploy_root_path = / (repo root)` with expected artifact paths at `/package.json`,
`/index.html`, `/vite.config.ts`, `/src/main.tsx`, `/public/_redirects`,
`/functions/api/`, `/functions/_lib/`. This directly conflicts with:

- `/job_site/full_parity_target_path_manifest.yaml` (on main and on branch) which
  declares `declared_deploy_root: apps/product-shell` and target paths
  `apps/product-shell/*`.
- The S3 foreman dispatch which names expected artifacts at `apps/product-shell/*`.
- `/job_site/deploy_root_plan.md` (on branch) which declares deploy root
  `apps/product-shell`.

Resolution applied for this pass: Executed per the target path manifest and
foreman dispatch (chassis-native deploy root `apps/product-shell`), because
three authorities agree against one. The pages_deployment_spec.md
divergence requires reconciliation by Factory Control Interface before S5
build verification.

### 8.2 fragment_allowlist.md (on main) is for RB-INT-CHASSIS-001

`/job_site/fragment_allowlist.md` (as present on origin/main) is titled
"Fragment Allowlist — RB-INT-CHASSIS-001 | S2" and declares
"No full-file verbatim copy of any gateway source file". The current run is
RB-INT-CHASSIS-002 whose objective is a "deployable identical working copy"
— which by definition requires verbatim baseline reconstruction of the deploy
app surface.

Resolution applied for this pass: The RB-INT-CHASSIS-001 fragment allowlist
was treated as a reference for a different job (per its own header) and not
applied to this RB-INT-CHASSIS-002 S3 pass. Whole-file verbatim copies were
used because the build-sheet-RB-INT-CHASSIS-002 objective and the S3 expected
artifact list require them. A RB-INT-CHASSIS-002-specific
`full_parity_fragment_allowlist.md` was not present on origin/main; if one is
produced that constrains this run, this pass may require re-evaluation.

Both conflicts are logged here so Foreman B / Factory Control Interface can
adjudicate before S5 begins.

## 9. Repo Mirror / Commit / Push Evidence

| field | value |
|---|---|
| repo_mirror | yes — writes made to working tree at `/home/user/gateway-fullbody-freeze/apps/product-shell/` |
| commit_required | yes |
| push_required | yes |
| branch | claude/inventory-app-structure-Ilqh1 |
| commit_hash | (recorded post-commit; see git log) |
| pushed_to | origin/claude/inventory-app-structure-Ilqh1 |

---

## 10. Checksum Pointers for Foreman B

- Every declared target path in `/job_site/full_parity_target_path_manifest.yaml` scope_lock.included exists at the declared path under `apps/product-shell/`.
- Every created file is a byte-for-byte copy of its declared baseline source.
- Scope lock is enforced — no file outside the declared scope was created, modified, or deleted.
- Two inter-reference conflicts (§8.1, §8.2) are flagged but did not block execution because the foreman dispatch, build sheet S3 expected artifacts, and target path manifest all align on `apps/product-shell/*`.

---

## 11. Append — Asset Reconstruction Pass (S3 follow-up)

job_id: RB-INT-CHASSIS-002
stage: S3
pass: deploy app asset reconstruction (styles + state + mobile)
worker: worker_a
branch: claude/create-missing-assets-epdo4
authority: record of exact file-system changes made under `apps/product-shell/src/` to satisfy the missing import surfaces flagged by `/job_site/build_verification_results.md` §5 and §9.1.

### 11.1 Trigger

S5 build verification (`/job_site/build_verification_results.md` §5) recorded that `npx vite build` from `apps/product-shell/` failed at Rollup module-graph resolution because `src/main.tsx` imports the following surfaces, which were classified `missing` in `/job_site/missing_surface_matrix.yaml` and explicitly deferred by the prior S3 deploy app surface pass (§6 of this manifest):

```
import { DemoGateProvider } from "./state/demoGateState";
import "./styles/global.css";
import "./styles/shell.css";
import "./styles/nav.css";
import "./styles/cards.css";
import "./styles/gate.css";
import "./styles/admin.css";
import "./styles/marketplace.css";
import "./styles/published-overlay.css";
import "./mobile/styles/mobile-overlay.css";
```

This append documents the reconstruction of exactly those 10 import targets (8 CSS files under `src/styles/`, 1 TSX state file under `src/state/`, 1 CSS file under `src/mobile/styles/`) plus the baseline-present sibling `src/mobile/README.md`, so that the missing-import cascade from `src/main.tsx` is closed.

### 11.2 Scope Lock (enforced)

Created exactly the surfaces listed in `/job_site/missing_surface_matrix.yaml` rows:

- `product-shell/src/state/demoGateState.tsx` (category `app_state`, deploy_critical: yes)
- `product-shell/src/styles/` (category `styles`, deploy_critical: yes — 8 CSS files)
- `product-shell/src/mobile/` (category `mobile`, deploy_critical: no — README.md + styles/mobile-overlay.css)

All other deferred surfaces from §6 of this manifest (components, features, pages, hooks, integrations, config, contracts, utils, public assets, tests, modules, admin apps, production, resolver, variation, review, docs) are NOT touched by this pass and remain classified `missing`.

### 11.3 Change Set Summary

| metric | value |
|---|---|
| files created | 11 |
| files modified | 0 |
| files deleted | 0 |
| directories created | 4 |
| total bytes written | 53860 |

### 11.4 Directories Created

- `apps/product-shell/src/styles/`
- `apps/product-shell/src/state/`
- `apps/product-shell/src/mobile/`
- `apps/product-shell/src/mobile/styles/`

### 11.5 Files Created

#### 11.5.1 src/state/

| target_path | baseline_path | bytes | action |
|---|---|---|---|
| apps/product-shell/src/state/demoGateState.tsx | product-shell/src/state/demoGateState.tsx | 4721 | create (verbatim) |

Exports: `DemoGateProvider` (React context provider consumed by `src/main.tsx`), `useDemoGate` (hook), `DemoGateState` (type), `Actions` (type). Imports only `react` (declared in baseline `apps/product-shell/package.json` dependencies). Introduces no cross-surface import.

#### 11.5.2 src/styles/

| target_path | baseline_path | bytes | action |
|---|---|---|---|
| apps/product-shell/src/styles/admin.css | product-shell/src/styles/admin.css | 22767 | create (verbatim) |
| apps/product-shell/src/styles/cards.css | product-shell/src/styles/cards.css | 1357 | create (verbatim) |

| apps/product-shell/src/styles/shell.css | product-shell/src/styles/shell.css | 2642 | create (verbatim) |

Subtotal: 8 files, 45937 bytes. Each file is a pure CSS stylesheet with no `@import` references to other product-shell surfaces.

#### 11.5.3 src/mobile/

| target_path | baseline_path | bytes | action |
|---|---|---|---|
| apps/product-shell/src/mobile/README.md | product-shell/src/mobile/README.md | 686 | create (verbatim) |
| apps/product-shell/src/mobile/styles/mobile-overlay.css | product-shell/src/mobile/styles/mobile-overlay.css | 2516 | create (verbatim) |

Subtotal: 2 files, 3202 bytes. The README is the baseline-present sibling of the styles directory and is included to mirror the baseline `product-shell/src/mobile/` subtree exactly.

### 11.6 Verification Against build_verification_results.md §9.1 Deferred Items

| build_verification_results §9.1 item | created_path | status |
|---|---|---|
| apps/product-shell/src/state/demoGateState.tsx | apps/product-shell/src/state/demoGateState.tsx | present |
| apps/product-shell/src/styles/admin.css | apps/product-shell/src/styles/admin.css | present |
| apps/product-shell/src/styles/cards.css | apps/product-shell/src/styles/cards.css | present |
| apps/product-shell/src/styles/gate.css | apps/product-shell/src/styles/gate.css | present |
| apps/product-shell/src/styles/global.css | apps/product-shell/src/styles/global.css | present |
| apps/product-shell/src/styles/marketplace.css | apps/product-shell/src/styles/marketplace.css | present |
| apps/product-shell/src/styles/nav.css | apps/product-shell/src/styles/nav.css | present |
| apps/product-shell/src/styles/published-overlay.css | apps/product-shell/src/styles/published-overlay.css | present |
| apps/product-shell/src/styles/shell.css | apps/product-shell/src/styles/shell.css | present |
| apps/product-shell/src/mobile/styles/mobile-overlay.css | apps/product-shell/src/mobile/styles/mobile-overlay.css | present |

All 10 missing-import targets named in `/job_site/build_verification_results.md` §5 are now present at their declared paths. The `src/mobile/README.md` baseline sibling is also present.

### 11.7 Out-of-Scope (still deferred after this pass)

The following baseline deploy-app surfaces remain classified `missing` and are NOT created by this asset reconstruction pass:

- `apps/product-shell/src/components/` (23 component files)
- `apps/product-shell/src/config/` (nav.config.ts, pageBackgrounds.ts, staticPageAssets.ts)
- `apps/product-shell/src/contracts/microfrontend.ts`
- `apps/product-shell/src/features/` (engage, marketplace, payme, referrals)
- `apps/product-shell/src/hooks/` (usePublishedExclusiveTiles.ts, useViewportMode.ts)
- `apps/product-shell/src/integrations/spine/` (bridge.ts, index.ts, registry.ts, types.ts)
- `apps/product-shell/src/pages/` (11 pages)
- `apps/product-shell/src/utils/` (5 util files)
- `apps/product-shell/public/ads/`, `public/apps/`, `public/demo/`, `public/wallpapers/`, `drip.png`
- `apps/product-shell/tests/microfrontend/`
- Module packages: `apps/modules/engage`, `apps/modules/payme`, `apps/modules/referrals`, `apps/modules/vault`
- Admin apps: `engagefi-admin-minimal`, `payme-admin-minimal`, `referral-admin-minimal`
- `production/`, `resolver-boundary/`, `variation-control/`, `_review-required/`

A subsequent rebuild pass is still required to close `src/app/router.tsx` → `../pages/*`, `../features/*`, `../components/*` cascade and the `build:engage` `apps/modules/engage/` cascade before the tree is end-to-end buildable.

### 11.8 Build-Time Dependency Alert (unchanged)

This append pass closes only the `src/main.tsx` direct-import cascade. The `src/app/router.tsx` → `../pages/*`, `../features/*`, `../components/*` cascade and the `build:engage` → `apps/modules/engage/` cascade are still present and will continue to fail S5 verification until those rebuild passes are executed.

### 11.9 Reference Conflict Status

The §8.1 (`pages_deployment_spec.md` deploy root mismatch) and §8.2 (RB-INT-CHASSIS-001 fragment allowlist) conflicts logged in this manifest remain unresolved by this pass. They are documentation-level conflicts and do not affect file-system writes under `apps/product-shell/src/{styles,state,mobile}/`. The RB-INT-CHASSIS-002-specific `/job_site/full_parity_fragment_allowlist.md` (§0 Pass Scope) explicitly limits its allowlist to `modules/*` and explicitly excludes "any … product-shell app-root surface", so this pass is not constrained by that allowlist.

### 11.10 Repo Mirror / Commit / Push Evidence

| field | value |
|---|---|
| repo_mirror | yes — writes made to working tree at `/home/user/gateway-fullbody-freeze/apps/product-shell/src/{styles,state,mobile}/` |
| commit_required | yes |
| push_required | yes |
| branch | claude/create-missing-assets-epdo4 |
| commit_hash | (recorded post-commit; see git log) |
| pushed_to | origin/claude/create-missing-assets-epdo4 |

### 11.11 Checksum Pointers for Foreman B

- Every created file is a byte-for-byte copy of its declared baseline source under `/tmp/baseline-freeze/product-shell/src/{styles,state,mobile}/`.
- Scope lock is enforced — no file outside `apps/product-shell/src/{styles,state,mobile}/` was created, modified, or deleted in this append pass.
- Every missing-import target named in `/job_site/build_verification_results.md` §5 is now present at the declared path.
- `src/main.tsx` no longer has any direct missing import. Its remaining failure modes (router → pages/features/components, build:engage → modules/engage) are unaffected by this pass and remain documented in §11.7 and §11.8.

---

## 12. Append — Route Reconstruction Pass (S3 follow-up)

job_id: RB-INT-CHASSIS-002
stage: S3
pass: deploy app route reconstruction (src/pages/ — router.tsx direct dependencies only)
worker: worker_a
branch: claude/create-missing-assets-epdo4
authority: record of exact file-system changes made under `apps/product-shell/src/pages/` to satisfy the missing route imports flagged by `/job_site/build_verification_results.md` (post-asset-reconstruction re-run) §5.2.

### 12.1 Trigger

The S5 verification re-run (`/job_site/build_verification_results.md` §5)
recorded that `npx vite build` from `apps/product-shell/` advanced from 3
modules transformed to 13 modules transformed (closing the §11 asset
cascade out of `src/main.tsx`) and then failed at:

```
Could not resolve "../pages/HomePage" from "src/app/router.tsx"
```

`apps/product-shell/src/app/router.tsx` (already present from §4.4 of this
manifest) contains the following 11 page-module imports:

```
import { HomePage } from "../pages/HomePage";
import { MembersPage } from "../pages/MembersPage";
import { AccessPage } from "../pages/AccessPage";
import { AccessTier1Page } from "../pages/AccessTier1Page";
import { AccessTier2Page } from "../pages/AccessTier2Page";
import { AccessTier3Page } from "../pages/AccessTier3Page";
import { PayMePage } from "../pages/PayMePage";
import { EngagePage } from "../pages/EngagePage";
import { ReferralsPage } from "../pages/ReferralsPage";
import { SkinMarketplacePage } from "../pages/SkinMarketplacePage";
import { AdminPage } from "../pages/AdminPage";
```

This append documents the reconstruction of exactly those 11 page-module
files (the immediate router dependencies). Per task dispatch, the cascade
beyond `src/pages/` (into `../components/*`, `../features/*`, `../hooks/*`,
`../utils/*`, `../runtime/*`, `../state/*`) is **not** expanded by this pass.

### 12.2 Scope Lock (enforced)

Created exactly the 11 router-direct page modules listed in
`/job_site/missing_surface_matrix.yaml` row `product-shell/src/pages/`
(category `pages`, deploy_critical: yes, notes: 11 page files):

- `product-shell/src/pages/AccessPage.tsx`
- `product-shell/src/pages/AccessTier1Page.tsx`
- `product-shell/src/pages/AccessTier2Page.tsx`
- `product-shell/src/pages/AccessTier3Page.tsx`
- `product-shell/src/pages/AdminPage.tsx`
- `product-shell/src/pages/EngagePage.tsx`
- `product-shell/src/pages/HomePage.tsx`
- `product-shell/src/pages/MembersPage.tsx`
- `product-shell/src/pages/PayMePage.tsx`
- `product-shell/src/pages/ReferralsPage.tsx`
- `product-shell/src/pages/SkinMarketplacePage.tsx`

All other deferred surfaces from §6 / §11.7 of this manifest
(`src/components/`, `src/features/`, `src/hooks/`, `src/integrations/`,
`src/config/`, `src/contracts/`, `src/utils/`, `public/` assets, tests,
modules, admin apps, production, resolver, variation, review, docs) are
NOT touched by this pass and remain classified `missing`.

### 12.6 Verification Against router.tsx Direct Imports

| router.tsx import specifier | created_path | status |
|---|---|---|
| `../pages/HomePage` | apps/product-shell/src/pages/HomePage.tsx | present |
| `../pages/MembersPage` | apps/product-shell/src/pages/MembersPage.tsx | present |
| `../pages/AccessPage` | apps/product-shell/src/pages/AccessPage.tsx | present |
| `../pages/AccessTier1Page` | apps/product-shell/src/pages/AccessTier1Page.tsx | present |
| `../pages/AccessTier2Page` | apps/product-shell/src/pages/AccessTier2Page.tsx | present |
| `../pages/AccessTier3Page` | apps/product-shell/src/pages/AccessTier3Page.tsx | present |
| `../pages/PayMePage` | apps/product-shell/src/pages/PayMePage.tsx | present |
| `../pages/EngagePage` | apps/product-shell/src/pages/EngagePage.tsx | present |
| `../pages/ReferralsPage` | apps/product-shell/src/pages/ReferralsPage.tsx | present |
| `../pages/SkinMarketplacePage` | apps/product-shell/src/pages/SkinMarketplacePage.tsx | present |
| `../pages/AdminPage` | apps/product-shell/src/pages/AdminPage.tsx | present |

All 11 direct page-module imports declared by `src/app/router.tsx` are now
present at their declared paths. The `src/app/router.tsx` direct-import
edge to `../pages/*` is closed.

### 12.7 Out-of-Scope (still deferred after this pass)

Per the dispatch directive "Do not expand beyond immediate router
dependencies", the following baseline surfaces — discovered to be imported
by the 11 reconstructed pages — are NOT created by this pass and remain
classified `missing`:

- `apps/product-shell/src/components/layout/PageShell.tsx`
  (imported by all 11 pages)
- `apps/product-shell/src/components/admin/AdminPanel.tsx`
  (imported by AdminPage, AccessTier3Page)
- `apps/product-shell/src/components/integrations/ModuleFrame.tsx`
  (imported by EngagePage, PayMePage, ReferralsPage)
- `apps/product-shell/src/features/payme/MemberBillingPanel.tsx`
  (imported by AccessTier1Page)
- `apps/product-shell/src/features/marketplace/state/cartStore.tsx`
  (imported by SkinMarketplacePage)
- `apps/product-shell/src/features/marketplace/pages/MarketplacePage.tsx`
  (imported by SkinMarketplacePage)
- `apps/product-shell/src/hooks/usePublishedExclusiveTiles.ts`
  (imported by AccessTier2Page)
- `apps/product-shell/src/utils/usdc.ts`
  (imported by AccessTier2Page)

Note: `../state/demoGateState` (imported by AccessTier2Page, AccessTier3Page)
and `../runtime/exclusiveTileHydration` (type-only import in AccessTier2Page)
are already present from §11 (asset reconstruction) and §4.x (runtime
support) and need no further action in this pass.

The remaining cascade above will continue to fail S5 verification at the
next module-graph layer until a subsequent rebuild pass closes
`src/components/`, `src/features/`, `src/hooks/`, and `src/utils/`.

### 12.8 Build-Time Dependency Alert (unchanged)

This append pass closes only the `src/app/router.tsx` → `../pages/*`
direct-import cascade. The downstream cascade
(`src/pages/* → ../components/*`, `../features/*`, `../hooks/*`,
`../utils/*`) and the `build:engage` → `apps/modules/engage/` cascade are
still present and will continue to fail S5 verification until those
rebuild passes are executed.

### 12.9 Reference Conflict Status

The §8.1 (`pages_deployment_spec.md` deploy root mismatch) and §8.2
(RB-INT-CHASSIS-001 fragment allowlist) conflicts logged in this manifest
remain unresolved by this pass. They are documentation-level conflicts and
do not affect file-system writes under `apps/product-shell/src/pages/`. The
RB-INT-CHASSIS-002-specific `/job_site/full_parity_fragment_allowlist.md`
(§0 Pass Scope) explicitly limits its allowlist to `modules/*` and
explicitly excludes "any … product-shell app-root surface", so this pass
is not constrained by that allowlist.

### 12.10 Repo Mirror / Commit / Push Evidence

| field | value |

### 12.11 Checksum Pointers for Foreman B

- Every created file is a byte-for-byte copy of its declared baseline source under `/tmp/baseline-freeze/product-shell/src/pages/`.
- Scope lock is enforced — no file outside `apps/product-shell/src/pages/` was created, modified, or deleted in this append pass.
- Every router.tsx direct page-import target is now present at the declared path.
- `src/app/router.tsx` no longer has any direct missing import. Its remaining failure modes are documented in §12.7 and §12.8 and are unaffected by this pass.

## 13. Append — Nav Subtree Reconstruction Pass (S3 follow-up)

job_id: RB-INT-CHASSIS-002
stage: S3
pass: deploy app nav reconstruction (`src/components/nav/` — `AppShell.tsx` direct dependency only)
worker: worker_a
branch: claude/rebuild-product-shell-KIQNp
authority: record of the file-system change made under `apps/product-shell/src/components/nav/` to satisfy the missing `TopNav` import flagged by `/job_site/build_verification_results.md` §15.2 (corrected `npx vite build` re-run).

### 13.1 Trigger

The corrected S5 `npx vite build` probe (`/job_site/build_verification_results.md`
§15.2) recorded that with `apps/product-shell` deps installed, vite config
loaded cleanly and Rollup advanced to 32 modules transformed, then failed at:

```
Could not resolve "../components/nav/TopNav" from "src/app/AppShell.tsx"
```

`apps/product-shell/src/app/AppShell.tsx` (already present from §4 of this
manifest) contains this single components-tree import:

```
import { TopNav } from "../components/nav/TopNav";
```

This append documents the reconstruction of exactly that one module (and
any direct sibling it imports from within `src/components/nav/`). Per task
dispatch, the cascade beyond `src/components/nav/` (into
`src/components/layout/`, `src/components/admin/`, `src/components/gate/`,
`src/components/integrations/`, `src/components/tenant/`, …) is **not**
expanded by this pass.

### 13.2 Scope Lock (enforced)

Created exactly the single `AppShell.tsx`-direct components-tree module:

- `apps/product-shell/src/components/nav/TopNav.tsx`

TopNav's own import list is recorded in §13.6. It imports zero modules from
inside `src/components/nav/`, so no additional files under that subtree
were required by this pass. All other missing `src/components/*` subtrees
(`layout/`, `admin/`, `gate/`, `integrations/`, `tenant/`) remain
classified `missing` in `/job_site/missing_surface_matrix.yaml` and are
untouched by this pass.

### 13.3 Change Set Summary

| metric | value |
|---|---|
| files created | 1 |
| files modified | 0 |
| files deleted | 0 |
| directories created | 2 (`src/components/`, `src/components/nav/`) |
| total bytes written | 1299 |
| reconstruction method | minimal chassis-native stub (no baseline archive available; content authored against existing `src/styles/nav.css` class contract and `src/app/routes.ts` route table; see §13.7) |

### 13.4 Directories Created

- `apps/product-shell/src/components/`
- `apps/product-shell/src/components/nav/`

### 13.5 Files Created

| target_path | bytes | action |
|---|---|---|
| apps/product-shell/src/components/nav/TopNav.tsx | 1299 | create (minimal chassis-native stub) |

### 13.6 TopNav Direct Import List (verified no nav-subtree siblings)

```
import { NavLink, Link } from "react-router-dom";
import { routes } from "../../app/routes";
```

| import specifier | resolves to | status |
|---|---|---|
| `react-router-dom` | `apps/product-shell/node_modules/react-router-dom/` (declared dep `^6.26.2`) | external, resolvable |
| `../../app/routes` | `apps/product-shell/src/app/routes.ts` | present (§4 of this manifest) |

TopNav imports zero modules from `src/components/nav/*` or from any other
`src/components/*` subtree. No sibling file under `src/components/nav/`
was required or created by this pass.

### 13.7 Reconstruction Rationale (no baseline archive)

- The baseline archive directory `/job_site/gateway-production-freeze/`
  is empty at HEAD (contains only `.keep`); no byte-for-byte baseline copy
  of `product-shell/src/components/nav/TopNav.tsx` is available on the
  attached file system.
- The minimal reconstruction uses only:
  - class names already declared in `apps/product-shell/src/styles/nav.css`
    (`topNav`, `topNavInner`, `brand`, `brandMark`, `brandText`,
    `brandTitle`, `brandTitleDesktop`, `brandTitleMobile`, `brandSub`,
    `brandSubDesktop`, `navLinks`, `navLink`, `navLink.active`,
    `topNavRight`, `loginTextBtn`, `cartIconBtn`);
  - the route table already declared in `apps/product-shell/src/app/routes.ts`
    (iterated to render one `<NavLink>` per route);
  - the public `react-router-dom` API (`Link`, `NavLink`).
- The reconstruction introduces no new subtree imports, no new external
  dependencies, and no new chassis surface. It satisfies the
  `AppShell.tsx → ../components/nav/TopNav` direct-import edge without
  touching any other module.
- The baseline-faithful content (interactive brand title, cart dropdown,
  wallet/login affordances, mobile menu toggle state) is not reconstructed
  by this pass and is deferred to a later baseline-archive-anchored pass.
  The minimal stub is sufficient for S5 `npx vite build` to advance past
  the `components/nav/TopNav` failing edge.

### 13.8 Verification Against AppShell.tsx Import

Post-write `npx vite build` probe (from
`/home/user/gateway-fullbody-freeze/apps/product-shell`, after
`npm install`):

- `✓ 32 modules transformed.` → continues past 32 (the prior failing point).
- The error `Could not resolve "../components/nav/TopNav" from "src/app/AppShell.tsx"`
  no longer occurs.
- The build now fails one hop deeper, at:
  `Could not resolve "../components/layout/PageShell" from "src/pages/HomePage.tsx"`
  — confirming the nav import resolved and the failing edge has advanced
  from `src/app/AppShell.tsx → ../components/nav/TopNav` to
  `src/pages/HomePage.tsx → ../components/layout/PageShell`.

### 13.9 Out-of-Scope (still deferred after this pass)

Per the dispatch directive "Do not expand beyond nav subtree", the
following baseline surfaces — known to be imported transitively by the
11 reconstructed pages (§12.7) and by the prior-declared component tree
inventory (baseline_inventory.md) — are NOT created by this pass and
remain classified `missing`:

- `apps/product-shell/src/components/layout/PageShell.tsx` (imported by all 11 pages)
- `apps/product-shell/src/components/layout/WallpaperLayer.tsx`
- `apps/product-shell/src/components/admin/AdminPanel.tsx` (imported by AdminPage, AccessTier3Page)
- `apps/product-shell/src/components/gate/*` (RequireGate and siblings — currently commented out in `router.tsx`)
- `apps/product-shell/src/components/integrations/ModuleFrame.tsx` (imported by EngagePage, PayMePage, ReferralsPage)
- `apps/product-shell/src/components/tenant/ExclusiveContentRenderer.tsx`
- `apps/product-shell/src/components/tenant/ExclusiveTileGrid.tsx`
- `apps/product-shell/src/features/*` (payme, marketplace, referrals, engage)
- `apps/product-shell/src/hooks/*`, `src/integrations/*`, `src/config/*`,
  `src/contracts/*`, `src/utils/*`

These subtrees will continue to fail S5 verification at the next
module-graph layer until a subsequent rebuild pass closes them.

### 13.10 Reference Conflict Status

The §8.1 (`pages_deployment_spec.md` deploy root mismatch) and §8.2
(RB-INT-CHASSIS-001 fragment allowlist) conflicts logged earlier in this
manifest remain unresolved by this pass. The
RB-INT-CHASSIS-002-specific `/job_site/full_parity_fragment_allowlist.md`
§0 Pass Scope explicitly limits its allowlist to `modules/*` and explicitly
excludes any `product-shell` app-root surface, so this pass is not
constrained by that allowlist.

### 13.11 Repo Mirror / Commit / Push Evidence

| field | value |
|---|---|
| repo_mirror | yes — write made to working tree at `/home/user/gateway-fullbody-freeze/apps/product-shell/src/components/nav/TopNav.tsx` |

### 13.12 Checksum Pointers for Foreman B

- Exactly one file was created under `apps/product-shell/src/components/nav/`.
- Scope lock is enforced — no file outside `apps/product-shell/src/components/nav/` was created, modified, or deleted in this append pass.
- `src/app/AppShell.tsx → ../components/nav/TopNav` is now resolvable; the `src/app/AppShell.tsx` direct-import edge to `../components/nav/*` is closed.
- The remaining cascade (`src/pages/* → ../components/layout/*` and siblings) is unchanged and is the next failing edge per §13.8.
- Because no baseline archive is available on the attached file system, the file is a minimal chassis-native stub (§13.7) and NOT a byte-for-byte baseline copy. This divergence from §11/§12 reconstruction method is noted here for Foreman B adjudication.

## 14. Append — Layout Subtree Reconstruction Pass (S3 follow-up)

job_id: RB-INT-CHASSIS-002
stage: S3
pass: deploy app layout reconstruction (`src/components/layout/` — all 11 pages' direct PageShell dependency)
worker: worker_a
branch: claude/rebuild-product-shell-KIQNp
authority: record of the file-system change made under `apps/product-shell/src/components/layout/` to satisfy the missing `PageShell` import flagged post-§13 by `npx vite build` ("Could not resolve `../components/layout/PageShell` from `src/pages/HomePage.tsx`").

### 14.1 Trigger

Post-§13 `npx vite build` from `/home/user/gateway-fullbody-freeze/apps/product-shell`
advanced from 32 modules transformed to 32+ and then failed at:

```
Could not resolve "../components/layout/PageShell" from "src/pages/HomePage.tsx"
```

Eleven pages import `PageShell` at the same import specifier (§12.7, §13.9):

```
import { PageShell } from "../components/layout/PageShell";
```

(from `HomePage.tsx`, `MembersPage.tsx`, `AccessPage.tsx`, `AccessTier1Page.tsx`,
`AccessTier2Page.tsx`, `AccessTier3Page.tsx`, `PayMePage.tsx`, `EngagePage.tsx`,
`ReferralsPage.tsx`, `SkinMarketplacePage.tsx`, `AdminPage.tsx`)

This append documents the reconstruction of exactly that one module (and
any direct sibling it imports from within `src/components/layout/`). Per
task dispatch, the cascade beyond `src/components/layout/` (into
`src/features/*`, `src/components/admin/*`, `src/components/integrations/*`,
`src/components/tenant/*`, …) is **not** expanded by this pass.

### 14.2 Scope Lock (enforced)

Created exactly the single page-direct layout module:

- `apps/product-shell/src/components/layout/PageShell.tsx`

PageShell's own import list is recorded in §14.6. It imports zero modules
from inside `src/components/layout/`, so no additional files under that
subtree were required by this pass. All other missing `src/components/*`
subtrees (`admin/`, `gate/`, `integrations/`, `tenant/`) remain classified
`missing` in `/job_site/missing_surface_matrix.yaml` and are untouched by
this pass. `src/components/layout/WallpaperLayer.tsx` (baseline_inventory.md
line 179) is NOT created by this pass because PageShell imports zero
sibling files from `src/components/layout/`; it is deferred to a later
baseline-archive-anchored pass.

### 14.3 Change Set Summary

| metric | value |
|---|---|
| files created | 1 |
| files modified | 0 |
| files deleted | 0 |
| directories created | 1 (`src/components/layout/`) |
| total bytes written | 376 |
| reconstruction method | minimal chassis-native stub (no baseline archive available; content authored against existing `src/styles/shell.css` class contract `.pageShell`, `.wallpaperLayer`, `.wallpaperImage`; see §14.7) |

### 14.4 Directories Created

- `apps/product-shell/src/components/layout/`

### 14.5 Files Created

| target_path | bytes | action |
|---|---|---|
| apps/product-shell/src/components/layout/PageShell.tsx | 376 | create (minimal chassis-native stub) |

### 14.6 PageShell Direct Import List (verified no layout-subtree siblings)

```
import type { ReactNode } from "react";
```

| import specifier | resolves to | status |
|---|---|---|
| `react` (type-only `ReactNode`) | `apps/product-shell/node_modules/react/` (declared dep `^18.3.1`) | external, resolvable |

PageShell imports zero modules from `src/components/layout/*` or from any
other `src/components/*` subtree. No sibling file under
`src/components/layout/` was required or created by this pass.

### 14.7 Reconstruction Rationale (no baseline archive)

- The baseline archive directory `/job_site/gateway-production-freeze/`
  is empty at HEAD (contains only `.keep`); no byte-for-byte baseline copy
  of `product-shell/src/components/layout/PageShell.tsx` is available on
  the attached file system.
- The minimal reconstruction uses only:
  - class names already declared in `apps/product-shell/src/styles/shell.css`
    (`.pageShell`, `.wallpaperLayer`, `.wallpaperImage`);
  - the public React type `ReactNode` for the `children` prop.
- The reconstruction introduces no new subtree imports, no new external
  dependencies, no chassis surface, and no new CSS classes. It satisfies
  the `{HomePage,MembersPage,Access*Page,PayMePage,EngagePage,ReferralsPage,SkinMarketplacePage,AdminPage}.tsx → ../components/layout/PageShell`
  direct-import edge without touching any other module.
- The baseline-faithful content (wallpaper source resolution,
  per-page-key background swap, scroll behavior, top-nav offset) is not
  reconstructed by this pass and is deferred to a later baseline-archive-anchored
  pass. The minimal stub is sufficient for S5 `npx vite build` to advance
  past the `components/layout/PageShell` failing edge.

### 14.8 Verification Against Page Imports

Post-write `npx vite build` probe (from
`/home/user/gateway-fullbody-freeze/apps/product-shell`, after
`npm install`):

- `✓ 41 modules transformed.` (advanced from 32 modules in §13.8).
- The error `Could not resolve "../components/layout/PageShell" from "src/pages/HomePage.tsx"`
  no longer occurs.
- The build now fails one hop deeper, at:
  `Could not resolve "../features/marketplace/state/cartStore" from "src/pages/SkinMarketplacePage.tsx"`
  — confirming the layout import resolved for all 11 pages and the failing
  edge has advanced from `src/pages/HomePage.tsx → ../components/layout/PageShell`
  to `src/pages/SkinMarketplacePage.tsx → ../features/marketplace/state/cartStore`.

### 14.9 Out-of-Scope (still deferred after this pass)

Per the dispatch directive "Do not expand beyond layout subtree", the
following baseline surfaces — known to be imported transitively by the
11 reconstructed pages (§12.7, §13.9) — are NOT created by this pass and
remain classified `missing`:

- `apps/product-shell/src/components/layout/WallpaperLayer.tsx`
  (baseline_inventory.md line 179; not imported by the minimal PageShell stub)
- `apps/product-shell/src/components/admin/AdminPanel.tsx`
  (imported by AdminPage, AccessTier3Page)
- `apps/product-shell/src/components/gate/*`
- `apps/product-shell/src/components/integrations/ModuleFrame.tsx`
  (imported by EngagePage, PayMePage, ReferralsPage)
- `apps/product-shell/src/components/tenant/ExclusiveContentRenderer.tsx`
- `apps/product-shell/src/components/tenant/ExclusiveTileGrid.tsx`
- `apps/product-shell/src/features/payme/MemberBillingPanel`
  (imported by AccessTier1Page)
- `apps/product-shell/src/features/marketplace/state/cartStore`
  (imported by SkinMarketplacePage — the next failing edge per §14.8)
- `apps/product-shell/src/features/marketplace/pages/MarketplacePage`
  (imported by SkinMarketplacePage)
- `apps/product-shell/src/hooks/*`, `src/integrations/*`, `src/config/*`,
  `src/contracts/*`, `src/utils/*`

These subtrees will continue to fail S5 verification at the next
module-graph layer until subsequent rebuild passes close them.

### 14.10 Reference Conflict Status

Unchanged from §13.10. The `/job_site/full_parity_fragment_allowlist.md`
§0 Pass Scope explicitly excludes any `product-shell` app-root surface, so
this pass is not constrained by that allowlist.

### 14.12 Checksum Pointers for Foreman B

- Exactly one file was created under `apps/product-shell/src/components/layout/`.
- Scope lock is enforced — no file outside `apps/product-shell/src/components/layout/` was created, modified, or deleted in this append pass.
- All 11 page modules' `../components/layout/PageShell` direct-import edges are now resolvable; the `src/pages/* → ../components/layout/PageShell` failing edge is closed.
- The next failing edge (§14.8) is `src/pages/SkinMarketplacePage.tsx → ../features/marketplace/state/cartStore`, outside this pass's scope.
- Because no baseline archive is available on the attached file system, the file is a minimal chassis-native stub (§14.7) and NOT a byte-for-byte baseline copy. This divergence from §11/§12 reconstruction method is noted here (same as §13.12) for Foreman B adjudication.

## 15. Append — Marketplace State Reconstruction Pass (S3 task dispatch)

job_id: RB-INT-CHASSIS-002
stage: S3
pass: product-shell marketplace state reconstruction (`src/features/marketplace/state/` only; resolve SkinMarketplacePage cartStore import)
worker: worker_a
branch: claude/rebuild-product-shell-KIQNp

### 15.1 Goal and scope lock

Goal: resolve `src/pages/SkinMarketplacePage.tsx` import of
`../features/marketplace/state/cartStore` by reconstructing only the
required `src/features/marketplace/state/` subtree.

Created exactly:

- `apps/product-shell/src/features/marketplace/state/cartStore.tsx`
- `apps/product-shell/src/features/marketplace/state/mockCatalog.ts`

No other `src/features/marketplace/*` paths were created or modified.

### 15.2 Implementation summary

- Added `mockCatalog.ts` with a typed `CatalogProduct` model and a minimal
  catalog fixture used by cart state.
- Added `cartStore.tsx` with:
  - `CartProvider` context wrapper consumed by `SkinMarketplacePage.tsx`
  - cart state (`lines`, `itemCount`) and actions (`addToCart`,
    `removeFromCart`, `clearCart`)
  - `useCartStore()` helper hook for downstream marketplace components.
- `cartStore.tsx` directly imports only `./mockCatalog`, satisfying the
  dispatch requirement to include direct sibling dependencies.

### 15.3 Verification

From `apps/product-shell`:

- `npx vite build`
  - previous edge (`../features/marketplace/state/cartStore`) is resolved.
  - first unresolved edge advances to
    `../features/marketplace/pages/MarketplacePage` from
    `src/pages/SkinMarketplacePage.tsx`, which is outside this task scope.

### 15.4 Out-of-scope handoff

Still missing and intentionally deferred by this pass:

- `apps/product-shell/src/features/marketplace/pages/MarketplacePage.tsx`
- `apps/product-shell/src/features/marketplace/components/*`
- any non-marketplace-feature subtree (`hooks/`, `utils/`, other features)
