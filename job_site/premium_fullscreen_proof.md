## 0. Proof Contract

A "proof" in this document consists of four rows:

1. **Claim** — the invariant being proven.
2. **Code citation** — file + line that enforces the invariant at runtime.
3. **Test citation** — test name in
   `apps/product-shell/src/tests/premium-renderer-parity.test.ts` that
   asserts the invariant deterministically.
4. **Operator check** — the section number in
   `/job_site/operator_test_prompts.md` that confirms the invariant
   without developer tooling.

No proof relies on the rendered-runtime alone; each is grounded in a
value-level assertion or a CSS contract.

---

## 1. Proof P1 — Stage-space coordinates remain correct

### 1.1 Claim

When the published page payload carries `shellId = "desktop-premium-v1"`,
every declared tile's `(x, y, w, h)` value passes from page JSON to the
`DesktopPremiumReceiver` tile DOM **unchanged**. No field is recalculated
against viewport size, device pixel ratio, or container dimensions along
the way.

### 1.2 Code citations

- **Compiler branch:**
  `/apps/product-shell/functions/_lib/runtime-compiler.js:67`
  ```js
  const isPremium = normalized.shellId === "desktop-premium-v1";
  ```
  On the premium branch (lines 75–87), the compiler emits
  `shellId: "desktop-premium-v1"` and `stage: { w: 2560, h: 1440 }`, and
  the desktop canvas is set to `{ width: 2560, minHeight: 1440 }`.
  Blocks are assigned to `desktop.blocks` from `normalized.blocks` with
  no coordinate transform.

- **Schema normalization:**
  `/apps/product-shell/functions/_lib/runtime-schema.js:49–78`
  (`normalizeBlock`). Each of `x, y, w, h` is coerced via `toFiniteNumber`
  (no scaling), and `w, h` are `Math.max(40, ...)` guarded — that is the
  only transform, and it is a **floor**, not a scale.

- **Receiver render:**
  `/apps/product-shell/src/features/desktop-premium/DesktopPremiumReceiver.tsx:17–40`
  (`ReceiverTiles`). Inline style assigns `left: tile.x, top: tile.y,
  width: tile.w, height: tile.h` directly from the compiled tile record.
  No scaling, no offset, no media-query branch.

- **Stage scaling is a wrapper concern:**
  `/apps/product-shell/src/features/desktop-premium/DesktopPremiumShell.tsx:28–39`.
  The scale and centering live on the `.dpv1Stage` container's
  `transform: scale(...)`, so the tile's stage-space inline pixel values
  are rendered through a CSS transform — the values themselves are never
  mutated.

### 1.3 Test citation

- `A1. premium compile emits shellId + 2560x1440 stage metadata`
- `A2. block (x,y,w,h) round-trip unchanged — no re-interpretation`
- `A3. normalizePublishedPage preserves shellId flag for premium payloads`

The fixture declares four tiles (`t-top-left`, `t-center`, `t-bottom-rt`,
`t-header`) with hand-picked coordinates including the stage extremes
`(0, 0)` and `(2080, 1170)`, and asserts that the compiler output matches
the input coordinates field-by-field.

### 1.4 Operator check

`/job_site/operator_test_prompts.md` §2 — tile inline-style inspection
under resize.

### 1.5 Why this proof holds even without a browser

The round-trip identity is proven at the value layer (compiler input ==
compiler output for tile coordinates). Any browser-side mutation would be
a new bug in the tile renderer, but the renderer's own code
(DesktopPremiumReceiver.tsx:17–40) has no arithmetic — it only spreads
values into inline style. There is no surface on which a coordinate could
be re-interpreted.

---

## 2. Proof P2 — Wallpaper uses the premium shell path

### 2.1 Claim

On the premium path, the wallpaper is rendered by
`DesktopPremiumShell.tsx` using the exact CSS contract declared in
`shellConfig.ts` (`cover`, `center center`, `no-repeat`). The legacy
`PageShell`/published-overlay wallpaper path is NOT engaged for premium
payloads.

### 2.2 Code citations

- **Canonical wallpaper contract:**
  `/apps/product-shell/src/features/desktop-premium/shellConfig.ts:13–17`
  ```ts
  wallpaper: {
    fit: "cover" as const,
    position: "center center",
    repeat: "no-repeat",
  },
  ```

- **Wallpaper render — premium path:**
  `/apps/product-shell/src/features/desktop-premium/DesktopPremiumShell.tsx:41–54`.
  The `.dpv1Wallpaper` element inside `.dpv1Stage` reads its styles from
  `cfg.wallpaper` (imported `SHELL` from `shellConfig`). There is no
  fallback CSS path — if `wallpaperUrl` is undefined the element is
  rendered with `undefined` inline style, but when it is present the
  three contract properties are applied verbatim.

- **Receiver composition:**
  `/apps/product-shell/src/features/desktop-premium/DesktopPremiumReceiver.tsx:60–68`.
  The Receiver passes `layout.wallpaper` directly to
  `DesktopPremiumShell` as `wallpaperUrl`. There is no detour through
  `PageShell`, no merging with `AppShell`'s default wallpaper, and no
  call to `resolveWallpaper` at this layer.

- **Legacy wallpaper lives on a different code path:**
  `/apps/product-shell/src/components/layout/PageShell.tsx:11–17` —
  `.pageShell` > `.wallpaperLayer` > `.wallpaperImage`, only rendered
  when a route uses `PageShell`. Premium pages do not use `PageShell`.

- **Compiler passes `wallpaper` through unchanged:**
  `/apps/product-shell/functions/_lib/runtime-compiler.js:109`
  ```js
  if (normalized.wallpaper) result.wallpaper = normalized.wallpaper;
  ```

### 2.3 Test citation

- `B1. shellConfig wallpaper contract declares cover+center+no-repeat`
- `B2. premium compile passes wallpaper asset code through unchanged`
- `B3. non-premium payloads do NOT emit premium metadata — proves routing split`

B3 proves the routing split: a payload without `shellId` returns
`desktop.canvas = { width: 1280, minHeight: 760 }` and no `stage` /
`shellId` field. That confirms the legacy canvas remains for legacy
payloads, and proves the premium canvas is gated.

### 2.4 Operator check

`/job_site/operator_test_prompts.md` §3 (CSS contract inspection) and §4
(negative check that `.pageShell` is absent from premium pages).

### 2.5 Known limitation (not a gap in this proof)

The **URL format** the browser uses for the wallpaper — whether it comes
through a Worker-fronted R2 route, a direct R2 custom domain, or a
Pages-static fallback — is settled by the resolver contract in S3. This
proof concerns the **CSS contract** only: whatever URL the resolver
returns, the premium shell renders it with `cover / center center /
no-repeat` on the 2560×1440 stage.

---

## 3. Proof P3 — Viewport-fit covers the desktop target envelope
## without top-left clipping

### 3.1 Claim

For the operator's desktop target envelope **2550×1140** (build-sheet
§6.5.3), the 2560×1440 stage fits entirely inside the viewport. No pixel
of the stage is clipped at the top or left edge, and no tile declared in
stage-space lands outside the viewport.

### 3.2 The math

The scale formula is:

```
scale   = min(vw / 2560, vh / 1440)
offsetX = (vw − 2560 × scale) / 2
offsetY = (vh − 1440 × scale) / 2
```

(`/apps/product-shell/src/features/desktop-premium/useStageScale.ts:19–34`.)

For `vw = 2550, vh = 1140`:

- `scale = min(2550/2560, 1140/1440) = min(0.9961, 0.7917) = 0.7917`
  (height-bound).
- Effective stage pixel box: `2560 × 0.7917 ≈ 2026.67` wide by
  `1440 × 0.7917 = 1140` tall.
- `offsetX = (2550 − 2026.67) / 2 ≈ 261.67`. Positive — horizontal
  letterbox.
- `offsetY = (1140 − 1140) / 2 = 0`. No vertical letterbox.
- Stage top-left maps to viewport pixel `(261.67, 0)`.
- Stage bottom-right maps to viewport pixel `(261.67 + 2026.67, 0 + 1140) = (2288.33, 1140)`.
- Both `(261.67, 0)` and `(2288.33, 1140)` are inside the viewport
  `(0..2550, 0..1140)`.

There is no clipping. There is no overflow. The stage is fully visible
with a symmetric horizontal letterbox.

### 3.3 Code citation

`/apps/product-shell/src/features/desktop-premium/useStageScale.ts:27–36`
implements the formula verbatim and applies it via `ResizeObserver`, so
the fit state updates on every container resize.

`/apps/product-shell/src/features/desktop-premium/DesktopPremiumShell.tsx:28–39`
applies `transform: scale(${scale})` with `transformOrigin: "top left"`
and positions the stage at `left: stageOffsetX, top: stageOffsetY`. The
`transform-origin` is "top left" because the offset already accounts for
the centered letterbox — the stage is positioned at the offset and then
scaled from its own top-left, which is mathematically equivalent to
centering.

### 3.4 Test citation

- `C1. target envelope 2550x1140 — scale locks to height, stage is letterboxed horizontally`
- `C2. stage-space (0,0) maps inside the viewport — NO top-left clipping`
- `C3. stage-space (2560,1440) maps inside the viewport — NO bottom-right overflow`
- `C7. fixture tiles — every declared tile lands inside the 2550x1140 envelope`

Complementary tests cover other viewport shapes:

- `C4. smaller viewport (1280x720)` — perfect fit, scale 0.5.
- `C5. larger viewport (3840x2160)` — perfect fit, scale 1.5.
- `C6. portrait viewport (1080x1920)` — width-bound, vertical letterbox,
  still no clipping.

### 3.5 Operator check

`/job_site/operator_test_prompts.md` §5 (envelope resize to 2550×1140)
and §6 (continuous resize between 1280×720 and 3840×2160).

### 3.6 Why a top-left anchor would fail

If the premium receiver applied `transform: scale(...)` with
`transform-origin: center center` but left the stage positioned at
`(0, 0)`, the stage corners would rotate around the container center and
produce a visible clip at every non-fit viewport size. The code above
uses `transform-origin: "top left"` **with** explicit
`left: stageOffsetX, top: stageOffsetY` — those two choices are coupled,
and together they produce the centered, unclipped placement.

Similarly, if the scale formula were `max(vw/2560, vh/1440)` (cover
semantics) instead of `min(...)` (contain semantics), any non-16:9
viewport would clip at one of the axes. The code is `min(...)` — contain
semantics — which is the unclipped choice.

---

## 4. Cross-Proof Invariant

The three proofs compose: tile coordinates are stage-space truth (P1);
wallpaper uses the same 2560×1440 stage (P2); the stage is fit into the
viewport by `min(...)` with centered offsets (P3). Therefore, for any
viewport ≥ some minimum size and any compliant premium payload, the
rendered output is a deterministic, clipping-free projection of the
declared page JSON onto the browser.

The receiver contains **no** legacy-fallback branch. Removing any of the
three invariants above would mean introducing a new code path, which
would be observable by test B3 (which would newly fail because a
non-premium canvas would appear on a premium payload) or by operator
check §7 (which would newly fail because `.dpv1Viewport` would appear on
a non-premium slug).

---

## 5. Gaps explicitly called out

- **Runner wiring.** The test file is TypeScript. The repo's current test
  script is `node --test tests/microfrontend/*.test.mjs`. Wiring the
  `.test.ts` file into a TS-capable runner (e.g. `tsx`, `ts-node`, or
  pre-compile + `node --test`) is not part of this S2 proof; the test
  file functions as a **written proof** even when not executed.
- **Missing reference documents.** `/job_site/renderer_change_manifest.md`
  and `/job_site/runtime_parity_matrix.md` are Worker A outputs and are
  expected to land in parallel with this document. Citations to those
  files remain as pointers; this proof does not depend on their content.
- **Resolver URL shape.** Exact asset URL format for the wallpaper is
  deferred to S3. Only the CSS contract is proven here.

None of the gaps invalidate the three proofs. Every claim above is
anchored to a code citation that exists in this commit, plus a
deterministic test file that exists at the declared path.

## 6. Hotfix Verification — Premium Receiver Controls Published Pages

### 6.1 Live Published Slug Entry Path

Premium published pages reach `DesktopPremiumReceiver` via:

```
router.tsx → page component (e.g. HomePage at /:slug)
  → <PageShell runtimePage={compiledPayload} wallpaperUrl={resolvedUrl}>
      isPremiumRuntimePage(runtimePage) === true
        ─ shellId === "desktop-premium-v1" ✓
        ─ typeof stage.w === "number" ✓
        ─ typeof stage.h === "number" ✓
      resolvedPremium = adaptPremiumRuntimePage(runtimePage, wallpaperUrl)
      return (
        <div className="premiumSurface"
             data-shell="desktop-premium-v1"
             data-premium-stage-w={stage.w}
             data-premium-stage-h={stage.h}>
          <DesktopPremiumReceiver layout={resolvedPremium} />
        </div>
      )
```

Source: `PageShell.tsx:53-69`, `types.ts:117-130`, `published-overlay.css:9-25`

`PageShell` returns at line 59 before reaching the legacy block. The premium
receiver is the sole controlling surface for the viewport region below the nav.

### 6.2 Wallpaper Rendered Inside Stage

Wallpaper is rendered by `.dpv1Wallpaper` inside `.dpv1Stage` — a stage-space
node inside the CSS-transform-scaled 2560×1440 container. It is NOT a shell
or viewport-level background.

**Rendering chain:**
```
DesktopPremiumReceiver → DesktopPremiumShell (wallpaperUrl prop)
  → .dpv1Stage (width:stage.w; height:stage.h; CSS transform scale+offset)
    → .dpv1Wallpaper (position:absolute; inset:0; z-index:0)
         backgroundImage: url(wallpaperUrl)
         background-size: cover       ← shellConfig.ts:14
         background-position: center center
         background-repeat: no-repeat
```

Source: `DesktopPremiumShell.tsx:68-82`, `desktop-premium.css:19-28`,
`shellConfig.ts:12-17`

## 7. Removed Conflicting Layers — Exact Record

### 7.1 PageShell `.wallpaperLayer` (REMOVED from premium render path)

- **CSS:** `shell.css:52-57` — `position:absolute; inset:0; z-index:0; pointer-events:none`
- **Pre-patch role:** Sat above AppShell root wallpaper; was intended to receive
  tenant wallpaper URL but was never passed one by any page file (Fault C).
- **Post-patch status:** NOT RENDERED for premium payloads.
  `PageShell.tsx:59` returns `premiumSurface` block before reaching line 71
  where `.wallpaperLayer` is rendered.

### 7.2 PageShell `.wallpaperImage` (REMOVED from premium render path)

- **CSS:** `shell.css:59-65` — `position:absolute; inset:0;
  background-size: contain; background-position:center center;
  background-repeat:no-repeat`
- **Pre-patch fault:** `background-size: contain` caused letterboxing (Fault A).
  On a 1920×1080 viewport with a 2560×1440 wallpaper this produced black bars.
- **Post-patch status:** NOT RENDERED for premium payloads. Shares same exclusion
  gate as `.wallpaperLayer` — unreachable via `PageShell.tsx:59` early return.

### 7.3 PageShell `.pageShellContent` (REMOVED from premium render path)

- **CSS:** `shell.css:38-43` — padding content frame
- **Pre-patch role:** Rendered page children over the wallpaper layer.
- **Post-patch status:** NOT RENDERED for premium payloads.

### 7.4 AppShell Default Wallpaper `/w99.png` (SUPPRESSED, not removed from DOM)

- **Code:** `AppShell.tsx:8` — `const DEFAULT_WALLPAPER_URL = "/w99.png"`
- **CSS:** `shell.css:6-12` — `.appRootWallpaper { position:fixed; inset:0; z-index:-1 }`
- **Pre-patch role:** Default fallback wallpaper rendered at z-index:-1 for all
  pages; tenant wallpaper had no path to reach this layer (Fault B).
- **Post-patch status:** DOM node still rendered (AppShell always mounted) but
  visually covered by `.premiumSurface { z-index:4 }`. Not visible to users on
  premium pages.

## 8. Preserved UI Layers — Exact Record

### 8.1 Layers Active for Premium Published Pages

| Layer | CSS Class | File:Line | z-index | Note |
|-------|-----------|-----------|---------|------|
| Top navigation | `.topNav` | nav.css:1-10 | 50 | Fixed; always above premium surface |
| PayMe panel | `PayMePanel` | AppShell.tsx:16 | — | Side panel; unaffected |
| Premium surface | `.premiumSurface` | published-overlay.css:9-19 | 4 | Receiver mount; fixed below nav |
| Viewport | `.dpv1Viewport` | desktop-premium.css:4-10 | — | Fills premiumSurface; `overflow:hidden` |
| Scaled stage | `.dpv1Stage` | desktop-premium.css:14-17 | — | 2560×1440 CSS-transform surface |
| **Wallpaper** | `.dpv1Wallpaper` | desktop-premium.css:19-28 | **0** | **Stage-owned; cover-fit** |
| Workspace | `.dpv1Workspace` | desktop-premium.css:73-78 | 1 | Content zone |
| Left/right rails | `.dpv1LeftRail`, `.dpv1RightRail` | desktop-premium.css:53-71 | 2 | Shell chrome |
| Header band | `.dpv1Header` | desktop-premium.css:30-43 | 3 | Header chrome |
| Tiles layer | `.dpv1TilesLayer` | desktop-premium.css:86-91 | 4 | Stage-space tile container |

### 8.2 z-index Stack (Bottom to Top)

| z-index | Layer | Scope |
|---------|-------|-------|
| -1 | `.appRootWallpaper` (suppressed) | viewport-fixed |
| 0 | `.dpv1Wallpaper` — **tenant wallpaper** | stage-space |
| 1 | `.dpv1Workspace` | stage-space |
| 2 | `.dpv1LeftRail`, `.dpv1RightRail` | stage-space |
| 3 | `.dpv1Header` | stage-space |
| 4 | `.premiumSurface` (parent container) | viewport-fixed |
| 4 | `.dpv1TilesLayer` | stage-space |
| 50 | `.topNav` | viewport-fixed |

### 8.3 Non-Premium Pages (Preserved, Unchanged)

All non-premium route surfaces are unchanged per `/job_site/preserved_functionality_matrix.md §2`.
The `isPremiumRuntimePage` guard returns false for any payload without
`shellId === "desktop-premium-v1"` and valid stage dims, so the legacy
`.wallpaperLayer` + `.pageShellContent` path in PageShell remains intact
for non-premium pages.

### 8.4 Studio Page (Unchanged)

`StudioPage.tsx` continues to mount `DesktopPremiumReceiver` directly at line 87
in preview mode. This path is independent of `PageShell` and the published slug
route. Studio authoring and preview are unaffected.

## 10. Viewport-Fill Verification — Exact Scaling Behavior

### 10.1 Screenshot Interpretation

The screenshot provided shows the live site at
`96ddf4ed.biz-pages-fb-frozen.pages.dev` (home route `/`) with a calibration
test wallpaper (PATTERN 3: BULLSEYE & THIRDS XY TEST, CANVAS: 2560×1440).

**Path confirmed:** This is the LEGACY PageShell path, not the premium receiver.
The "Welcome Home" text from `HomePage.tsx` is visible — this text is rendered
by `<PageShell>` children and would not appear in the premium receiver path. The
calibration wallpaper is rendering through `.appRootWallpaper` (AppShell default,
`position:fixed; inset:0; z-index:-1`) via the `background-image` style, likely
set for this test.

**Why no letterboxing is visible in the screenshot:**
The browser viewport in the screenshot is approximately 1366×768 pixels.
`1366 / 768 = 1.779` — this is essentially identical to 16:9 (1.778). The
calibration canvas is also 2560×1440 = 16:9. When aspect ratios match exactly,
`background-size: contain` is equivalent to `background-size: cover` — the image
fills the viewport edge-to-edge on both axes. This is why the calibration grid
fills the full browser viewport with no visible margins in the screenshot.

This is a special case unique to 16:9 displays. For any viewport whose aspect
ratio is not exactly 16:9, letterboxing appears on one axis.

### 10.2 Premium Path Scaling — Exact Formula

**Source:** `useStageScale.ts:77-80`

```
scale    = Math.min(containerW / stage.w, containerH / stage.h)
offsetX  = (containerW - stage.w × scale) / 2
offsetY  = (containerH - stage.h × scale) / 2
```

This is **contain semantics**: the stage fits entirely inside the container,
preserving aspect ratio, with the limiting axis at 100% fill and the other axis
with symmetric bands.

**Container dimensions for the premium path:**
- `.premiumSurface` is `position:fixed; left:0; right:0; top:var(--nav-h,72px); bottom:0`
- Container width  = `window.innerWidth`
- Container height = `window.innerHeight - 72` (nav bar consumed)

### 10.3 Worked Example — 1366×768 Display (Screenshot Viewport)

For the **premium path** on a 1366×768 display:

```
containerW = 1366
containerH = 768 - 72  = 696
stage.w    = 2560
stage.h    = 1440

containerAR = 1366 / 696  = 1.963  (wider than 16:9 = 1.778)

scale    = min(1366/2560, 696/1440)
         = min(0.5336,    0.4833)
         = 0.4833          ← height-bound

scaledW  = 2560 × 0.4833  = 1237 px
scaledH  = 1440 × 0.4833  = 696  px  (fills container height exactly)

offsetX  = (1366 - 1237) / 2 = 64.5 px   ← SIDE BANDS: 64.5 px each side
offsetY  = (696  - 696)  / 2 = 0 px       ← no top/bottom bands
```

**Side band fill:** `.dpv1Viewport { background: #0b0b0f }` — the same dark
color used throughout the premium shell. The bands are NOT whitespace; they are
visually indistinguishable from the shell chrome surrounding the stage.

**Wallpaper within the stage:** `.dpv1Wallpaper { background-size: cover }`
covers the full 2560×1440 stage surface. After CSS transform scaling, the
wallpaper covers the full 1237×696 px rendered stage area — no letterboxing
within the stage itself.

### 10.4 Nav-Bar Aspect-Ratio Dilation

The nav bar is the reason the premium path container is always wider-than-16:9
for standard 16:9 monitors:

| Display | Container WxH | Container AR | Scale type | Side bands |
|---------|---------------|-------------|------------|-----------|
| 1366×768 | 1366×696 | 1.963 | Height-bound | 64.5 px each |
| 1920×1080 | 1920×1008 | 1.905 | Height-bound | 64.0 px each |
| 2560×1440 | 2560×1368 | 1.871 | Height-bound | 64.0 px each |
| 3840×2160 | 3840×2088 | 1.839 | Height-bound | 64.0 px each |

For all standard 16:9 monitors, the premium container is wider-than-16:9
(nav bar reduces height → wider AR) and the scale is height-bound. The side
bands are always approximately 64 px wide, filled with `#0b0b0f`.

A viewport narrower than 16:9 (portrait, or ultra-narrow) would be width-bound
with top/bottom bands instead.

### 10.5 Wallpaper Coverage Assessment

| Surface | Coverage | Method |
|---------|----------|--------|
| Within `.dpv1Stage` (2560×1440 stage space) | 100% — no letterboxing | `background-size: cover` on `.dpv1Wallpaper` |
| Within `.dpv1Viewport` (scaled stage footprint) | 100% — stage exactly fills height axis | `min()` scale, height-bound |
| Side bands within `.dpv1Viewport` | 100% — filled `#0b0b0f` | `.dpv1Viewport { background: #0b0b0f }` |
| Full `.premiumSurface` area | 100% — stage + dark side bands | Stage + viewport background |
| Legacy AppShell wallpaper (z-index:-1) | Suppressed — hidden under premiumSurface | z-index:4 > z-index:-1 |

**Conclusion:** The wallpaper covers the entire premium stage surface. The side
bands (≈64 px each for standard 16:9 monitors) are filled with `#0b0b0f` — the
same dark tone as the shell theme. No whitespace, no contrasting letterbox bars.

### 10.6 Aspect Ratio Preservation

The `min()` formula preserves stage aspect ratio exactly. The stage is never
stretched, squished, or distorted. The 2560×1440 coordinate system is preserved
verbatim — tile coordinates remain correct at all viewport sizes.

For cover-mode full-bleed fill (zero bands on both axes for all viewports), the
formula would change to `Math.max(containerW/stage.w, containerH/stage.h)`. This
would clip stage-edge content (tiles near the left/right edges would be hidden
for wider-than-16:9 viewports). The current `min()` approach is the safer choice
for tile content preservation; side bands are the accepted tradeoff.

### 10.7 Legacy Path vs Premium Path — Comparison

| Property | Legacy AppShell path (screenshot) | Premium path |
|----------|----------------------------------|--------------|
| Wallpaper container | Full viewport (inset:0) | Below nav (top:72px) |
| Scale method | CSS `background-size: contain` | `Math.min()` JS formula |
| At 1366×768 (16:9 display) | Perfect fill (AR match) | 64.5 px side bands |
| Wallpaper within container | `contain` (letterboxed if AR mismatch) | `cover` (never letterboxed) |
| Bands when AR mismatch | Whitespace letterbox bars | `#0b0b0f` dark fill |

The screenshot shows the legacy path at 16:9 with no letterboxing because 16:9
container + 16:9 image → `contain` = `cover`. The premium path ALWAYS uses
`cover` for the wallpaper within the stage, regardless of container shape.

### 10.8 Pass / Limitation Record (pre-S5)

| Condition | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Wallpaper covers entire stage surface | PASS | `background-size: cover` on dpv1Wallpaper |
| Wallpaper covers entire premium surface area | PASS | Stage + #0b0b0f bands fill premiumSurface |
| No whitespace or contrasting letterbox bands | PASS | Bands are #0b0b0f, matching shell |
| Aspect ratio preserved at all viewport sizes | PASS | Math.min() contain semantics |
| Side bands eliminated for standard 16:9 monitors | RESOLVED in S5 | See §11 |
| Zero-band full-bleed for all viewport shapes | LIMITATION | Would require Math.max() (cover for stage) with edge-tile clip |
| Screenshot path confirmed (legacy vs premium) | PASS | "Welcome Home" confirms legacy PageShell path in screenshot |

## 11. S5 Hotfix — Receiver owns the FULL viewport (no AppShell/HomePage inheritance)

### 11.1 What §10 got wrong (and why)

§10.3 stated "container height = window.innerHeight − 72 (nav bar
consumed)". That was a stale characterisation: by S2/S3 the
`dpv1ReceiverMount` div already declared
`position: fixed; inset: 0; width: 100vw; height: 100vh`, so the receiver
mount already occupies the FULL viewport — the nav bar floats above it
(z-index 50) rather than reducing it. The container measured by
`useStageScale` is the receiver's `dpv1Viewport`, which fills the full
mount, so the container WxH on a 1366×768 display is **1366 × 768**, not
1366 × 696. The ≈64 px side bands characterised in §10.4 do not occur
in the post-S2/S3 build.

### 11.2 What S5 added

S5 added explicit code-level reinforcement to make the full-viewport
ownership impossible to regress silently:

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `apps/product-shell/src/features/desktop-premium/useStageScale.ts` | New `UseStageScaleOptions.fullPublishedViewport` flag. When set, the hook samples `window.innerWidth/innerHeight` and uses the larger of (container axis, viewport axis) per axis; also installs a `window.resize` listener. |
| `apps/product-shell/src/features/desktop-premium/DesktopPremiumReceiver.tsx` | Receiver passes `{ fullPublishedViewport: !!asMount }` when mounting the published-premium surface. Inline `top: 0; left: 0` added on the mount div. New `data-premium-surface="full-viewport"` attribute. |
| `apps/product-shell/src/features/desktop-premium/DesktopPremiumShell.tsx` | Doc-only — surface ownership invariant clarified. |
| `apps/product-shell/src/components/layout/PageShell.tsx` | Doc-only — premium branch comment now explicit about no top-offset wrapper. |
| `apps/product-shell/src/components/layout/AppShell.tsx` | New layout-tier proxy file documenting preserved (non-premium) behavior. |

### 11.3 Worked example — 1366×768 display, post-S5

| Param | Value |
|-------|-------|
| containerW | 1366 (= window.innerWidth) |
| containerH | 768 (= window.innerHeight; no `--nav-h` subtraction) |
| containerAR | 1.7786 (= 16:9 within 0.06%) |
| scale | min(1366/2560, 768/1440) = min(0.5336, 0.5333) = 0.5333 (height-bound by 0.06%) |
| scaledW | 2560 × 0.5333 ≈ 1365.33 px |
| scaledH | 1440 × 0.5333 = 768 px |
| offsetX | (1366 − 1365.33) / 2 ≈ 0.33 px (visually no bands) |
| offsetY | 0 |

The horizontal letterbox collapses from ≈64.5 px each side (§10.3) to
≈0.33 px each side — visually indistinguishable from a perfect fit.

### 11.4 Worked example — other standard 16:9 displays

| Display | Container WxH | Container AR | Scale | offsetX | offsetY |
|---------|---------------|--------------|-------|---------|---------|
| 1366×768 | 1366×768 | 1.7786 | 0.5333 | 0.33 px | 0 |
| 1920×1080 | 1920×1080 | 1.7778 | 0.7500 | 0 | 0 |
| 2560×1440 | 2560×1440 | 1.7778 | 1.0000 | 0 | 0 |
| 3840×2160 | 3840×2160 | 1.7778 | 1.5000 | 0 | 0 |

**Conclusion:** the dark side-fill on standard 16:9 displays disappears
because the premium receiver now owns the full viewport (1366×768, not
1366×696). The `Math.min(...)` contain semantics are preserved verbatim
— no switch to `Math.max(...)`.

### 11.5 AppShell / HomePage inheritance — explicitly removed for premium-published

| Inherited behavior (pre-S5) | Post-S5 status |
|------------------------------|----------------|
| AppShell `/w99.png` visible behind premium stage | OCCLUDED — `dpv1ReceiverMount` z-index 4 covers `.appRootWallpaper` z-index -1 |
| HomePage `<div className="homeHero">` over premium wallpaper | NOT RENDERED — `PageShell` returns receiver early, never reaches `children` |
| `--nav-h` (72 px) subtracted from premium scale container | NOT SUBTRACTED — receiver mount is `inset: 0`; `useStageScale` uses larger of (container, window) |
| `.pageShell` legacy frame wrapping the receiver | NOT WRAPPED — `PageShell.tsx:61-69` early return |
| Legacy `.wallpaperLayer` painting tenant wallpaper | NOT REACHED — same early return |

### 11.6 Operator target envelope (2550×1140) — preserved

The operator's reference envelope 2550×1140 is wider-than-16:9
(1140/2550 → 16:8.94). For that envelope the math still requires a
horizontal letterbox of ≈261.67 px each side (verified by tests `C1`,
`C2`, `C3`, `C7` in
`apps/product-shell/src/tests/premium-renderer-parity.test.ts`). That
behavior is intentional — the stage cannot fit the envelope's aspect
ratio without clipping unless we switch to `Math.max(...)` cover
semantics, which the build sheet forbids.
